# Predicting Space Mission Success

## Description:

- This project involves predicting the success of space missions using machine learning techniques. 
- The dataset used for this project is "Space_Corrected.csv".
- The goal is to build a model that can classify whether a space mission will be successful or not based on various features.

## Libraries Used:

- numpy: Numerical operations and array manipulation.
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib.pyplot: Creating visualizations.
- re: Regular expression operations.
- sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder: Encoding categorical variables.
- sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: Feature scaling.
- sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: Splitting dataset.
- tensorflow: Building and training models.

## Dataset:

Dataset: "Space_Corrected.csv" with mission details.

## Steps:

1. Load dataset with pandas.
2. Preprocess data, handle missing values, encode categories.
3. Scale features with MinMaxScaler.
4. Split data into train and test sets.
5. Build a TensorFlow model, train, and evaluate.
6. Analyze model performance and refine.

## Project Overview:

Predict space mission success using ML on "Space_Corrected.csv". Preprocess, analyze data, build, and evaluate a TensorFlow model.

## Instructions:

1. Install required libraries with:
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow

2. Download "Space_Corrected.csv" and place in project directory.

3. Modify code's file path to dataset location.

4. Execute code to:
   - Load and preprocess data.
   - Split into training and testing sets.
   - Build and train TensorFlow model.
   - Evaluate model's performance.
